<h1>About</h1>
<p><strong>From the author</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in my new data visualization project. There are many great COVID-19 Canada dashboards available online. I have compiled the following list to show some of the dashboards that inspired me to build this one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/">The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Groups dashboard</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/JPSoucy">Jean-Paul R. Soucy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ishaberry2">Isha Berry</a>, two amazing talented students from my school, DLSPH, at Univerity of Toronto.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/italy_dash">The Covid19 Italy dashboard</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rami_Krispin">Rami Krispin</a>. I used Rami’s <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19Italy">R markdown code</a> for this dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/">The Esri Canada COVID-19 Canada dashboard</a>.</p></li>

<p>Using the four COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group’s spreadsheets on cases, mortality, recovery and testing at <a href="https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada" class="uri">https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada</a>, I created an aggregated Canada COVID-19 daily data. You can view this data on the data page of this dash.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I want to give a shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/suivicovid">Marc-Olivier Hétu</a> whom I met on <a href="https://twitter.com/suivicovid">twitter</a>. He has been scraping public COVID-19 Canada since March and compiled an outstanding spreadsheet with graphic analysis, which he generiously shared with me, because he said he’s glad that more people get to use his data to build tools. I have adopted one of Marc’s special figure on this dash and I named it the Marc-Olivier figure to carry on the legacy.</p>

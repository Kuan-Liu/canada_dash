## From the author

**Thank you for your interest in my new data visualization project.**
There are many great COVID-19 Canada dashboards available online. I have
compiled the following list to show some of the dashboards that inspired
me to build this one.

  - [The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Groups
    dashboard](https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/) made by
    [Jean-Paul R. Soucy](https://twitter.com/JPSoucy) and [Isha
    Berry](https://twitter.com/ishaberry2), two amazing talented
    students from my school, DLSPH, at Univerity of Toronto.

  - [The Covid19 Italy
    dashboard](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/italy_dash) by [Rami
    Krispin](https://twitter.com/Rami_Krispin). I used Rami’s [R
    markdown code](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19Italy) for this
    dashboard.

  - [The Esri Canada COVID-19 Canada
    dashboard](https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/).

  - [The PHAC COVID-19 Canada
    dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2f1a13ca0b29422f9b34660f0b705043/),
    **most accurate and reliable** info on Canadian COVID-19
    epidemiology data.

  - [The Ontario-specific COVID-19 Analysis
    Website](https://howsmyflattening.ca/#/analysis) which covers
    detailed Ontario focused analytical information on critical care
    analysis, health region analysis and testing analysis. This website
    I believe was also built by a group of University of Toronto
    students.

  - [The Québec provincial COVID-19
    dashboard](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees).

  - [The Alberta provincial COVID-19
    dashboard](https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/).

Using the four COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group’s spreadsheets on
cases, mortality, recovery and testing at
<https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada>, I created an aggregated
Canada COVID-19 daily data. You can view this data on the data page of
this dash.

Last but not least, I want to give a shout-out to [Marc-Olivier
Hétu](https://twitter.com/suivicovid) whom I met on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/suivicovid). He has been scraping public
COVID-19 Canada data since March and compiled an outstanding spreadsheet
with graphic analysis, which he generiously shared with me, because he
said he’s glad that more people get to use his data to build tools. I
have adopted one of Marc’s special figure on this dash and I named it
the Marc-Olivier figure to carry on the legacy.
